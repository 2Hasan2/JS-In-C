# JavaScript Number Methods

JavaScript provides a variety of built-in methods for working with numbers and performing operations on them. In this README, we'll cover some commonly used number-related methods in JavaScript.

## Number Conversion

- `parseInt()`: Parses a string and returns an integer.

- `parseFloat()`: Parses a string and returns a floating-point number.

- `Number()`: Converts an object or a value to a number.

- `toString()`: Converts a number to a string.

## Number Properties

- `MAX_VALUE`: The largest representable number in JavaScript.

- `MIN_VALUE`: The smallest positive representable number in JavaScript.

- `NaN`: Represents "Not-a-Number" when a mathematical operation fails.

- `Infinity`: Represents positive infinity.

- `NEGATIVE_INFINITY`: Represents negative infinity.

- `toFixed()`: Formats a number to a specified number of decimal places and returns a string.

## Mathematical Operations

- `Math.abs()`: Returns the absolute value of a number.

- `Math.round()`: Rounds a number to the nearest integer.

- `Math.ceil()`: Rounds a number up to the nearest integer.

- `Math.floor()`: Rounds a number down to the nearest integer.

- `Math.random()`: Returns a random floating-point number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive).

- `Math.min()`: Returns the smallest number from a list of arguments.

- `Math.max()`: Returns the largest number from a list of arguments.

- `Math.pow()`: Returns the result of raising a number to a specified power.

- `Math.sqrt()`: Returns the square root of a number.

- `Math.sin()`, `Math.cos()`, `Math.tan()`: Returns the trigonometric sine, cosine, and tangent of an angle, respectively.

- `Math.log()`: Returns the natural logarithm of a number.

- `Math.exp()`: Returns e raised to the power of a number.

- `Math.PI`: The mathematical constant representing the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter.

- `Math.E`: The mathematical constant representing Euler's number.

This is not an exhaustive list of JavaScript number methods, but it covers some of the most commonly used ones. These methods can be very useful for performing various mathematical and numerical operations in your JavaScript applications.
